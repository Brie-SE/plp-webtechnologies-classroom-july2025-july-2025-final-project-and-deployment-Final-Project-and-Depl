Empowering students with modern math and digital tools:<br><br>
In Kenya, digital literacy is becoming increasingly essential
for academic and professional success, yet many students in
underserved communities face limited access to digital
resources and skills training. According to the Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), only about 22% of households
in Kenya have access to the internet at home, with this
percentage significantly lower in rural and low-income areas.
Furthermore, the World Bank highlights that digital skills are
crucial for over 90% of jobs worldwide, making it critical for
young people to develop these competencies early.
In Kayole 1 Comprehensive School, the average score in the
2024 mathematics end term assessments study remains
below the desired proficiency levels, with many students
struggling in foundational areas like data handling, logic, and
applied math concepts that are critical for digital literacy.
These challenges limit students' readiness for higher
education and their ability to participate in a digital economy.<br><br>

Solution:The Digitali Math Club aims to bridge the digital literacy and math skills
gap among students in underserved communities by
providing a structured program that integrates
foundational digital and mathematical concepts. Through
this project, students in the Junior Secondary Section receive hands-on
training in essential skills like data handling, logical
reasoning, and applied math using digital tools such as
Wayground, programming and AI resources. By leveraging accessible
technology, the Digitali Maths Club fosters an engaging
learning environment where students can improve their
math proficiency and develop critical digital skills,
essential for their academic advancement and future
career opportunities.
The program includes interactive workshops, mentorship
sessions, and access to online resources, ensuring that
students gain practical, real-world experience in
navigating digital platforms. By building both math and
digital literacy competencies, the Digitali Maths Club not
only boosts students' readiness for higher education but
also equips them with the tools needed to participate
actively in a digital economy. This initiative addresses the
core educational barriers identified at Kayole 1
Comprehensive School and empowers students to
succeed in a technology-driven world.
